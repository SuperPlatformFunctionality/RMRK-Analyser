# RMRK Analyser

### TODO:
- Because code of sendInteraction function in rmrk-tools do not call interface of dbApater 
  when Removing NFT from children of previous owner and Adding NFT as child of new owner.
  So the funtionality of send NFT to another NFT is imcomplete, need to fix. 
  but the removing and adding result must be write to the json implement by json dbAdapter,
  find where to implement it.
